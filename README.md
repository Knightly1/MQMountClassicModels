# MQMountClassicModels

Emulator servers do not have the live update that allows you to mount while using classic models.  This plugin will
allow you to mount while you have classic models turned on.  Of course, you'll look a little goofy, but at least you
can ride!

## Getting Started

```txt
/plugin MQMountClassicModels
```

## Other Notes

Emulator doesn't currently have the ability to camp while on a mount.  In fact, it checks to see if you're mounted
and is supposed to tell you to get off the mount and camp.  This might be something to look into in the future.
